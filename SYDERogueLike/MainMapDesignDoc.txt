BASIC FLOW:
On each turn, the player will be able a certain number of spaces (like a dice roll). On each space there will be an event, such as:
- Shop
- Battle
- Boss Fight
- Other Event

the board will look like:
------<=======

as different paths will end up in a different boss fight.

The boss fought at the end will determine the next level the player goes to, with an eventual final level which has one final boss.

On events such as battles, we need to send the player into a fight scene, and return us on finish.

We will probs also need to handle backgrounds and shit.


MAP DESIGN:
The paths will be generated in a image file, with the rgb Values determing the data of the space.

R - Pool of the spawn
	200 = Split path
	105 = Random Space
	28 = Boss
	etc
G - Path Number
	0 = Initial path, when split it will change number
		(IN CONFIG FILE, WE WILL SET WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE AT EACH SPLIT, eg 200,0,25 = {2} as paths to split onto)
B - Position of the path
	0 = start of path, when/if we split we can move to this starting point

Having the data like this will allow us to determine the set paths for all movement outside of code. This will be created similarly to how Wildspawns worked in SYDE_QUEST

RGB_DATA 0,0,0 will be the start position in the map :)

SINCE one pixel = 2 On engine side, each board piece will take up 2 code wise '()' or '><' or maybe '[]'. Either way it'll look like a square

Additionally, we should create a [map_name].config file which we can use to set all possible battle pools & shop data and other stuff
