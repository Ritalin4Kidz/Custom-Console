Feedback:
Labcat - -
	Would be nice to be able to move between rounds in the Season News.
	And have what round it was.
	To check team stats I have to go to the main menu, right? That would also be neat to be able to check contextually.
	Maybe you could put a "featured match" in the Season tab, with the two closest matched teams being in a seperate tab

## ABANDONED IDEAS

- Watch the next game (live feed of play by play comes in and screen updates accordingly)
